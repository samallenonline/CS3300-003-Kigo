<h1>CS3300 Software Development Project</h1>

**Team members:** Kelly Lowrance, Noah Kabel, Sam Allen <br>
**Project title:** Kigo <br>
**Functionality:** Our program will utilize several APIs to display haikus that are generated using song lyrics from the user’s most-listened songs. It will do this by first pulling the user’s listening history and identifying the user’s most-listened songs. 
Then, it will pull lyrics from one of these songs, parse them to fit the specifications of a haiku, and then display the haiku. <br>
