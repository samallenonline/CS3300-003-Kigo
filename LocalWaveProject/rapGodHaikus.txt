Look, I was gonna
go easy on you not to hurt your feelings But

I'm only going to
get this one chance Something's wrong, I can feel it

Just a feeling I've
got, like something's about to happen, but I

And if he is as
bananas as you say, I'm not taking any

chances You are just
what the doc ordered I'm beginnin' to feel like

a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back

nod Now, who thinks their
arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? They

said I rap like a
robot, so call me Rap-bot But for me to rap

like a computer,
it must be in my genes I got a laptop in

my back pocket My
pen'll go off when I half-cock it Got a fat knot

from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it Ever

still be able to
break a motherfuckin' table Over the back

of a couple of
faggots and crack it in half Only realized it

was ironic, I
was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could

I not blow? All I
do is drop F-bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers

disastrously bad
for the wack While I'm masterfully constructing

this masterpi√®ce 'Cause
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

All my people from
the front to the back nod, back nod Now, who thinks their

arms are long enough
to slap box, slap box? Let me show you maintainin'

this shit ain't that hard,
that hard Everybody want the key and

loves to root for
a nuisance Hit the Earth like an asteroid

'Cause I use it as
a vehicle to "Bus the rhyme" Now I lead a

Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey
Doc, Ren Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

To meet Run-D.M.C., induct
them Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall

Only Hall of Fame
I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame

On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock

of flames Off a
plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?

Little gay-lookin'
boy So gay, I can barely say it with a

straight face, lookin' boy
You're witnessin' a mass-occur Like you're watching

a church gathering
take place, lookin' boy "Oy vey, that boy's gay!" That's

a "Way to go" from
your label every day, lookin' boy Hey,

lookin' boy! What you
say, lookin' boy? I get a "Hell, yeah" from Dre, lookin'

boy I'ma work for
everything I have, never asked nobody

'cause- I'm beginnin'
to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people

from the front to the
back nod, back nod The way I'm racin' around the

track, call me NASCAR,
NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the

in this chicken scratch
I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe

try to help get some
people through tough times But I gotta keep a

few punchlines Just in
case 'cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry

lookin' at me like
it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I

To censor you like
that one line I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers

LP when I Tried to say
I'll take seven kids from Columbine Put 'em all

with it now that I
ain't as big as I was, but I'm Morphin' into

with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal! And I just bought

to a man while he
played piano Man, oh man, that was a - special on

demonstrating How
to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling

be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I

make elevating
music, you make elevator music "Oh, he's

too mainstream" Well, that's
what they do when they get jealous, they

confuse it "It's not
hip-hop, it's pop, " 'cause I found a hella way to

fuse it With rock, shock
rap with Doc Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose

it I don't know how
to make songs like that I don't know what words to use

Let me know when it
occurs to you While I'm rippin' any one of

half as nice, your songs
you could sacrifice virgins too? Ugh, school flunky,

pill junkie But look
at the accolades these skills brung me Full of

I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when

I speak in tongues,
but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you I'm drunk, so,

I can feel tugging
and struggling Angels fight with devils and here's

what they want from
me They're askin' me to eliminate some

of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the

to the situation
And understand the discrimination But fuck

it, life's handin'
you lemons? Make lemonade then! But if I can't

batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake

then? Don't mistake him
for Satan; it's a fatal mistake If you think

and make her fall on
her face and Don't be a retard, be a king? Think
