'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
(Hey, hey, hey)
I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I look around and
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
I'm going through withdrawals
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
I'm running out of time
I've been on my own for long enough
I've been tryna call
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
No one's around to judge me (oh)
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty (oh)
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
Yeah
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
You don't even have to do too much
