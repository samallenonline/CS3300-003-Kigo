Feel like Romeo, Moncler coat when it's cold
Off a flat, I'm not feeling you
That is true, can't be seen with you, but it's cool
I froze myself, now I'm freezing you
Fuck life and your feelings too
Nightmares coming true
Creepin' up black Audi truck and I'm dripping blood
Today I've been fallin' fallin' fallin'
Don't know what you say
You keep callin' callin' callin' out my name
No talking, I don't want to hear you talking
I'm not sorry, I'm just honest
I am in the heart of darkness
For me, you don't have to do anything
When I'm in your area the flowers start withering
Ice world, everything glittering
Ice girl, I'ma ice her with some better things
I'ma treat myself with fucking medicine
To feel something, I'd do anything
I've been only moving up and leveling
You fucked up again, you let the devil in
Feel like Romeo, Moncler coat when it's cold
Off a flat, I'm not feeling you
That is true, can't be seen with you, but it's cool
I froze myself, now I'm freezing you
Fuck life and your feelings too
Nightmares coming true
Creepin' up black Audi truck and I'm dripping blood
Feel like Romeo, Moncler coat when it's cold
Off a flat, I'm not feeling you
That is true, can't be seen with you, but it's cool
