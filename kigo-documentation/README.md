# Kigo Developer Documentation

## Overview

Kigo is a web application that generates personalized haikus using lyrics from a user's most-listened songs. It integrates React for the front end, Node.js for the backend, and Java libraries compiled into JAR files for processing logic. This documentation provides an overview of the app's architecture, key components, and guidance for future developers to maintain or extend the application.

## Code Convention Details 

### Primary Languages:

- **Java:** 
Used for backend logic in the JAR libraries.

- **JavaScript:** 
Used for the Node.js backend and React frontend.

- **HTML and CSS:** 
Used for frontend design and user interface styling.

### Compilers:

- **Java Compiler (Maven):** For compiling the Java libraries into JAR files.

- **Node.js Runtime Environment:** Executes the backend and serves the frontend application.

### Configuration Management:

- **Spotify Integration:** The Spotify Web API was implemented first to handle client IDs, secrets, and authorization tokens.

- **Lyric Fetching:** The lyrics.ovh API was integrated to retrieve lyrics for the user's top tracks.

- **Syllable Counting Algorithm:** Parallelly, the algorithm to process lyrics and count syllables for haiku generation was developed.

- **Frontend and Backend Integration:** The React frontend and Node.js backend were built and connected to the JAR files for processing logic.

- **Testing and Deployment:** Final integration and testing ensured adequate operation before deploying the app.

### Comments and Logic:

**Code Comments:**

- Effective comments are consistently present across the codebase and offer insight into the purpose of key methods, functions, and components.
- Backend and frontend files include comments explaining core logic, such as route handling and component functionality, to ensure clarity for future developers.

### Logic Structure:

The codebase adheres to modular design principles:

- Each Java class encapsulates a specific functionality (ex. Spotify data retrieval, lyric processing).
- Node.js handles API requests as separate routes, ensuring a clean and scalable structure.
- React components follow a logical hierarchy, with state management for user data and dynamic rendering for haikus.

## Architecture Overview

Kigo follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend (React)**

Framework: React.js

Purpose: Provides a visually appealing and interactive user interface for the app, allowing users to navigate the app, authenticate with Spotify, and view personalized haikus.

Key Features:
- GUI that ensures a user-friendly experience for navigating the app's functionality.  
- Spotify authentication and haiku generation flow.
- Dynamic rendering of user-specific data.
- Account preferences stored in local data.

2. **Backend (Node.js)**

Framework: Express.js

Purpose: Acts as a middle man by managing communication between the frontend and backend and ensuring seamless functionality across all components. 

Key Features:
- Serves the React app.
- Manages routes such as /login, /callback, and /generate-haiku.
- Executes Java JAR files to complete various tasks such as retrieving Spotify data, fetching song lyrics, processing these lyrics, and generating personalized haikus. 

3. **Java Libraries (JAR Files)**

Purpose: Provides the core logic for the app, implemented through modular and resuable Java components. 

Components:
- Spotify API integration for retrieving top tracks.
- Lyrics fetching and processing.
- Haiku generation algorithms using syllable counting logic.

## Key Components

1. **Frontend**

Location: kigo/src

Key Files:
- App.js: Manages routing and overall layout.
- Index.js: Initializes the React app.
- Account.js: Displays user preferences and account information.
- App.css: Styling for components defined in App.js.

How It Works: 
Upon visiting the app, the user is presented with a home screen prompting Spotify authentication. Once authenticated, the frontend communicates with the backend for data retrieval and haiku generation. Generated haikus are displayed dynamically.

2. **Backend**

Location: kigo/index.js

Key File:
- index.js: Defines backend routes and communicates with the Java libraries.

Routes:
- /: Root route, displays a welcome message. Offers no functionality and is used for testing purposes only.  
- /login: Redirects the user to Spotifyâ€™s authentication page.
- /callback: Handles the redirect after Spotify authentication and processes the access token.
- /fetch-lyrics: Retrieves lyrics from the user's top tracks via the kigonoah JAR file.
- /generate-haiku: Invokes the haiku generation logic via the kigokelly JAR file.
- /get-haiku: Retrieves all haikus contained in the /haiku folder and prepares them to be displayed on the user interface. 
  
How It Works:
The backend uses the Spotify API to retrieve user data and integrates the lyrics.ovh API for lyrics retrieval. Java JAR files are executed using Node.js child_process to handle various processing and logic. 

3. **Java Libraries**

Location: kigokelly and kigonoah

Key Files:

Spotify Authorization and Data Retrieval (kigonoah):
- AuthorizationCode.java: Exchanges the authorization code for an access token.
- AuthorizationCodeUri.java: Generates the Spotify authorization URI.
- CompileLyrics.java: Coordinates the process of fetching relevant user data, retrieving lyrics for the user's top tracks, and storing them as text files in the /lyrics folder. 
- LyricsOvhFetcher.java: Fetches song lyrics using the lyrics.ovh API.
- UserTopTracks.java: Fetches the user's top tracks using the Spotify API.

Lyric Processing and Haiku Generation (kigokelly):
- SyllableCounter1.java: Counts the number of syllables in a given word.
- ProcessLyricLines.java: Cleans and processes raw song lyrics.
- HaikuFinder.java: Finds and generates haikus from processed song lyrics. 
- RemoveDuplicateLines.java: Further processes lyrics by removing duplicate lines.

How It Works:
The Java libraries handle Spotify authentication, data processing, and haiku generation.
These libraries are compiled into JAR files, which the backend executes during runtime.

## Current Limitations 

1. **Dependency on External APIs**

The Kigo app relies heavily on the Spotify API for user data and the lyrics.ovh API for lyric retrieval. If these APIs experience downtime, rate limiting, or unexpected changes, core functionalities like haiku generation may fail. Additionally, Lyrics.ovh contains a limited database of lyrics and often does not provide lyrics for lesser-known tracks. 

2. **Limited Compatibility with Streaming Platforms**

This software is only compatible with the music streaming service Spotify. Users who use other streaming services like Pandora, Apple Music, Soundcloud, or YouTube Music will not be able to use the software.

3. **Error Handling**

Basic error handling and debugging logs are implemented, which facilitate development. However, user-facing error messages are limited and could be improved to better communicate issues, such as missing data, API failures, or unexpected inputs.

4. **Missing feature implementation**

Some planned features (though non-essential), such as the haiku gallery and additional user preferences are not yet implemented.

Overall, the software operates adequately and meets most user expectations by achieving essential functionality.
